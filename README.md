# calender-application
This is a very simple nine to five calendar application for logging events for the day. However, I am now transitioning this to a full stack application that will assist with picking up sub shifts in any timezone for edx full stack development bootcamp courses.

# Current Progress
I am currently working on implementing all queries for graphql from backend to frontend. The MVP will most likely not include user authentication, but instead, I can use this app personally to keep track of my scheduled shifts at edx. I might even begin to use it just to keep track of my work as well. I believe the idea behind this is that I want an extremely personizable calender that works exactly for me. Especially considering that I will ned to constantly work in different time zones.

# Weekly planner for full stack. User directions below. 

I want to be able to add new weeks.
    - Simply click a button and a new 7 days will pop up and save itself.
    - This is currently being automated, so I only need to add the shift, and if the week that the shift date is in, does not exist, it will create a new week and then add the shift, or it will add the shift to an already existing week. 
I want old weeks to remove themselves when the dates are no longer relevant.
    - I want a screen to show 'future weeks'
    - old weeks will be archived
I want each day to be able to see my availability to the relevant timezones for each day. 
I want to be able to add shifts with in its relevant times zone
    - when the shifts are added, my availability for the other time zones will be automatically updated

# What is the MVP?
1. The real MVP is when I can open this up and see my availability in all timezones based off of the current shift load I am working with.
