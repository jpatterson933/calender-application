My webpage can accomplish the list of things below.
1. The top banner provides the user with a title and the current date and time that they will use the nine to five planner.
    A. Within the banner is a clear all button. This button will alllow the user to clear all tasks and events that have been scheduled. Placed at the top so when the page is loaded at the beginning of their day they can clear page and start new day.

2. When the user enters text and clicks save. The text/task they input will stay as long as they do not clear the entire page or click the time button to clear the hour.
