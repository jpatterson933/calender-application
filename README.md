This is a very simple nine to five calendar application for logging events for the day.

# Weekly planner for full stack. User directions below. 

I want to be able to add new weeks.
    - Simply click a button and a new 7 days will pop up and save itself.
I want old weeks to remove themselves when the dates are no longer relevant.
    - I want a screen to show 'future weeks'
    - old weeks will be archived
I want each day to be able to see my availability to the relevant timezones for each day. 
I want to be able to add shifts with in its relevant times zone
    - when the shifts are added, my availability for the other time zones will be automatically updated

I will need a backend database that saves data. This will require routes, as well data washing. I will most likely have a sign in form that requires the user to sign in in order to access their account homepage. There will only be 1 page to view.

# What is the MVP?
1. USER should be able to login and view a page that says hello and the information will be saved in a database. User will be automatically logged out after several minutes.
